## Species types

### Prokaryotes

- Greek meaning prenucleus

- e.g.: Bacteria and archaea 

- Their chromosomes are not contained within a membrane-bound nucleus of the cell. Prokaryotes usually have a single type of circular chromosome in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.

### Eukaryotes

- Greek meaning true nucleus

- e.g.: as single-celled protists and some fungi (such as yeast), plants, animals

## DNA in Eukaryotes

- In addition to the nucleus, certain organelles in eukaryotic cells contain a small amount of their own DNA. They are referred to as extranuclear or extrachromosomal DNA to distinguish it from the DNA that is found in the cell nucleus.
